# Salary Estimation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Problem Type:** Regression / Classification  
**Dataset:** Salary Dataset (e.g., experience, education, role-based features)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on estimating salary based on various input features
such as years of experience, education level, and job-related attributes.
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used to make predictions by
comparing similar data points.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the salary dataset
- Performed data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Trained a KNN model with an appropriate value of K
- Evaluated model performance using relevant metrics

## Algorithm Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The KNN model provides reasonable salary estimates by leveraging similarity
between data points and demonstrates the importance of feature scaling.

## Notes
This project is intended as a beginner-level implementation to understand
instance-based learning and the KNN algorithm.
