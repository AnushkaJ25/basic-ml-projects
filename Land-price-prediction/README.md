# Land Price Prediction using Linear Regression

**Problem Type:** Regression  
**Dataset:** Land Price Dataset (e.g., location, area, and other features)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting land prices based on various features
such as location, area, and other relevant attributes. A Linear Regression
model is used to learn the relationship between input features and land prices.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the land price dataset
- Performed data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated model performance using regression metrics

## Algorithm Used
- Linear Regression

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The Linear Regression model provides a baseline prediction for land prices
and demonstrates the relationship between input features and price.

## Notes
This project is intended as a beginner-level regression task to understand
supervised learning and linear regression.
