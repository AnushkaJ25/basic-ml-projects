# Land Price Prediction using Logistic Regression

**Problem Type:** Classification  
**Objective:** Predict land price category based on input features

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict land price categories (such as high, medium, or
low) using Logistic Regression. The model classifies land prices based on
various features related to location, size, and other relevant attributes.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the land price dataset
- Performed data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Converted price values into categorical labels
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluated the model using classification metrics

## Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The Logistic Regression model is able to classify land prices into categories
with reasonable accuracy, serving as a simple and effective baseline model.

## Notes
This project is intended as a beginner-level classification task to understand
logistic regression and its application in real-world price classification
problems.
