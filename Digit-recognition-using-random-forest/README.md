#Digit recommendation 
# Digit Recognition using Random Forest

**Problem Type:** Multi-class Classification  
**Dataset:** Handwritten Digits (e.g., MNIST / sklearn digits dataset)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits (0–9) using a
Random Forest classifier. The goal is to correctly classify digit images
based on their pixel values.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the handwritten digits dataset
- Preprocessed image data for model training
- Trained a Random Forest classifier
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification metrics

## Algorithms Used
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The Random Forest model achieves good classification accuracy and is able
to distinguish between handwritten digits effectively.

## Notes
This project is intended as a beginner-level implementation to understand
multi-class classification and ensemble learning using Random Forests.
