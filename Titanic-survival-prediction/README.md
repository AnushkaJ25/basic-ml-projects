# Titanic Survival Prediction using Naive Bayes

**Problem Type:** Binary Classification  
**Dataset:** Titanic Passenger Dataset

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster
based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and family
information. A Naive Bayes classifier is used to perform the prediction.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoded categorical features and handled missing values
- Trained a Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluated the model using classification metrics

## Algorithm Used
- Naive Bayes (Gaussian Naive Bayes)


## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The Naive Bayes model is able to predict passenger survival with reasonable
accuracy and serves as a simple baseline for classification tasks.

## Notes
This project is a beginner-level implementation designed to understand
probabilistic classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
