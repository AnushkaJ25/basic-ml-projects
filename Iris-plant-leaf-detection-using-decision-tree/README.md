# Iris Leaf Detection using Decision Tree

**Problem Type:** Multi-class Classification  
**Dataset:** Iris Flower Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species
(Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on leaf (sepal and petal)
measurements. A Decision Tree classifier is used to perform the classification.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- Performed data preprocessing and feature analysis
- Trained a Decision Tree classifier
- Visualized and evaluated model performance

## Algorithm Used
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The Decision Tree model is able to classify iris species effectively and
provides interpretable decision rules for classification.

## Notes
This project is a beginner-level implementation designed to understand
tree-based learning and decision-making in machine learning.
