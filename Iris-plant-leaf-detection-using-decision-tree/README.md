# Iris Leaf Detection using Naive Bayes

**Problem Type:** Multi-class Classification  
**Dataset:** Iris Flower Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species
(Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on leaf (sepal and petal)
measurements. A Naive Bayes classifier is used to perform the classification.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset
- Performed data preprocessing and feature analysis
- Trained a Naive Bayes classifier
- Evaluated the model using classification metrics

## Algorithm Used
- Naive Bayes (Gaussian Naive Bayes)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The Naive Bayes model is able to classify iris species effectively and achieves
good accuracy on the dataset.

## Notes
This project is a beginner-level implementation designed to understand
probabilistic classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
