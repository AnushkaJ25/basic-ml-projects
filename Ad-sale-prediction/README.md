# Ad Sale Prediction using Logistic Regression

**Problem Type:** Classification  
**Dataset:** Advertising / Sales Dataset (e.g., TV, Radio, Newspaper spend vs Sales Categories)

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether ad campaigns will result in a high or
low sales category based on advertising spend across different media channels
(TV, Radio, Newspaper). A Logistic Regression model is used for this binary
classification task.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the advertising dataset
- Performed data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Converted sales values into categories (e.g., high vs low)
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluated the model using classification metrics

## Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression
- 
## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The Logistic Regression model is able to classify ad campaigns into high or
low sales categories with reasonable accuracy, providing insights into which
advertising channels are most effective.

## Notes
This project is intended as a beginner-level classification task to understand
logistic regression and its application in marketing analytics.
