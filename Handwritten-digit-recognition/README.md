# Handwritten Digit Recognition using SVM Classifier

**Problem Type:** Multi-class Classification  
**Dataset:** Handwritten Digits Dataset (e.g., MNIST / sklearn digits)

## Project Overview
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to recognize
handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The model learns patterns from pixel values of
digit images and predicts the correct digit class.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the handwritten digits dataset
- Preprocessed image data for model training
- Trained an SVM classifier with appropriate kernel
- Evaluated model performance using standard classification metrics

## Algorithm Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)


## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The SVM classifier achieves good accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits and
demonstrates strong performance for multi-class classification tasks.

## Notes
This project is a beginner-level implementation aimed at understanding SVMs and
their application in image-based classification problems.
