# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

**Problem Type:** Regression
**Dataset:** House Price Dataset 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features such
as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors. A Linear
Regression model is used to learn the relationship between input features and
house prices.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the house price dataset
- Performed data preprocessing and feature selection
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated the model using regression performance metrics

## Algorithm Used
- Linear Regression

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Results
The Linear Regression model provides a baseline solution for house price
prediction and demonstrates how numerical features influence housing prices.

## Notes
This project is intended as a beginner-level regression task to understand the
fundamentals of supervised learning and linear regression.
